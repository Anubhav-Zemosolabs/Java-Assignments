        Local variables are declared mostly to do some calculation. So
        it's the programmer's decision to set the value of the variable and
        it should not take a default value.
        If the programmer, by mistake, did not initialize a local variable
        and it takes a default value, then the output could be some
        unexpected value. So in case of local variables, the compiler
        will ask the programmer to initialize it with some value before
        they access the variable to avoid the usage of undefined values.
